abstract = {The Telling Board uses the concept of storyboarding (organizing graphics in sequence) to enable children ages 6 and up to conceptualize and build their own narratives. By populating square grids on the board with their choice of either pre-illustrated or their own hand drawn "story cards," children practice crafting stories in sequence from beginning to end. They are able to tell those stories and share them via a built-in recording mechanism on the board.We hope to discover how The Telling Board drives creative thinking and may encourage children to practice verbal communication of personally meaningful stories. In this paper, we describe the design of The Telling Board, analyze the meaning of storyboarding, story crafting, and storytelling. In addition, we will explore future direction of the tool.},

abstract = {Co-creative systems have been widely explored in the field of computational creativity. However, existing AI partners of these systems are mostly virtual agents. As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.},

        abstract = {Project-based learning can encourage and motivate students to learn through exploring their own interests, but introduces special challenges for novice programmers. Recent research has shown that novice students perceive themselves to be bad at programming, especially when they do not know how to start writing a program, or need to create a plan before getting started. In this paper, we present PlanIT, a guided planning tool integrated with the Snap! programming environment designed to help novices plan and program their open-ended projects. Within PlanIT, students can add a description for their project, use a to do list to help break down the steps of implementation, plan important elements of their program including actors, variables, and events, and view related example projects. We report findings from a pilot study of high school students using PlanIT, showing that students who used the tool learned to make more specific and actionable plans. Results from student interviews show they appreciate the guidance that PlanIT provides, as well as the affordances it offers to more quickly create program elements.},

In this paper, we introduce a temporal analytics framework for stealth assessment that analyzes students' problem-solving strategies. The strategy-based temporal analytic framework uses long short-term memory network-based evidence models and clusters sequences of students' problem-solving behaviors across consecutive tasks. We investigate this strategy-based temporal analytics framework on a dataset of problem-solving behaviors collected from student interactions with a game-based learning environment for middle school computational thinking. The results of an evaluation indicate that the strategy-based temporal analytics framework significantly outperforms competitive baseline models with respect to stealth assessment predictive accuracy.},

	abstract     = {This paper describes a generative theory of bugs. It claims that all bugs of a procedural skill can be derived by a highly constrained form of problem solving acting on incomplete procedures. These procedures are characterized by formal deletion operations that model incomplete learning and forgetting. The problem solver and the deletion operator have been constrained to make it impossible to derive “star‐bugs”—algorithms that are so absurd that expert diagnosticians agree that the alogorithm will never be observed as a bug. Hence, the theory not only generates the observed bugs, it fails to generate star‐bugs. The theory has been tested on an extensive data base of bugs for multidigit subtraction that was collected with the aid of the diagnostic systems buggy and debuggy. In addition to predicting bug occurrence, by adoption of additional hypotheses, the theory also makes predictions about the frequency and stability of bugs, as well as the occurrence of certain latencies in processing time during testing. Arguments are given that the theory can be applied to domains other than subtraction and that it can be extended to provide a theory of procedural learning that accounts for bug acquisition. Lastly, particular care has been taken to make the theory principled so that it can not be tailored to fit any possible data. {\textcopyright} 1980 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

However, prior studies have been conducted at a single institution on a small or medium scale, without the possibility of data re-use. Now, the widespread availability of always-on Internet access allows for data collection at a much larger, global scale. In this paper we report on the Blackbox project, begun in June 2013. Blackbox is a perpetual data collection project that collects data from worldwide users of the BlueJ IDE -- a programming environment designed for novice programmers. Over one hundred thousand users have already opted-in to Blackbox. The collected data is anonymous and is available to other researchers for use in their own studies, thus benefitting the larger research community. In this paper, we describe the data available via Blackbox, show some examples of analyses that can be performed using the collected data, and discuss some of the analysis challenges that lie ahead.},

This research identified higher levels of knowledge component gaps and misunderstandings when assessing transaction-level knowledge component data than task-level final solution data. Final solution data showed little evidence that students had any misunderstanding or knowledge gaps about the use of absolute references. However, when analyzing these data at the transaction level we found evidence that far more students struggled than the analysis of the final solutions suggested.},

	abstract     = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Focusing on this challenge, a new assessment tool, called Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R) is presented in this paper. LAe-R is based on the concept of assessment rubrics which is a very popular assessment technique in education. LAe-R contains "enriched" criteria and grading levels that are associated to data extracted from the analysis of learners' interaction and learning behavior in an e-learning environment. LAe-R has been developed as a plug-in for the Moodle learning management system. Via an example, we will show how LAe-R can be used by teachers and students.},

This analysis has not previously been done. EER-Tutor is one such constraint-based ITS, which teaches conceptual database design using Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) data modelling. As with any ITS, a lot of data about each student's interaction within EER-Tutor are available: as individual student models, containing constraint histories, and logs, containing detailed information about each student action. This work can be extended to other ITSs and their relevant domains.},

In Studies 1 and 2, the performance of participants evaluated with the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique (IF AT), a testing method providing immediate feedback and enabling participants to answer until correct, was compared to that of participants responding to identical tests with Scantron answer sheets. Performance on initial tests did not differ, but when retested after delays of 1 day or 1 week, participants evaluated with the IF AT demonstrated higher scores and correctly answered more questions that had been initially answered incorrectly than did participants evaluated with Scantron forms. In Study 3, immediate feedback and answering until correct was available to all participants using either the IF AT or a computerized testing system on initial tests, with the final test completed by all participants using Scantron forms. Participants initially evaluated with the IF AT demonstrated increased retention and correctly responded to more items that had initially been answered incorrectly. Active involvement in the assessment process plays a crucial role in the acquisition of information, the incorporation of accurate information into cognitive processing mechanisms, and the retrieval of correct answers during retention tests. Results of Studies 1-3 converge to indicate that the IF AT method actively engages learners in the discovery process and that this engagement promotes retention and the correction of initially inaccurate response strategies.},

	abstract     = {We last presented our Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) course in a special issue of ACM Inroads in June 2012 [13]. At the time, we taught BJC in two of the first five CS Principles national pilots at UC Berkeley and University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Many things have changed since those early days, with more than two hundred high school teachers offered BJC professional development (PD) through four NSF grants, a transition to our blocks-based online software platform Snap! (based on Scratch) with cloud support [18], and a partnership with professional high school curriculum developers at EDC (Education Development Center), who are working with us to further refine our curriculum. Through partnerships with EDC, the New York City Department of Education, and CSNYC, our NSF-funded BJC4NYC project will bring BJC to 100 high school teachers in New York City, the largest and one of the most diverse school districts in the country. Finally, after two years of preparation, we launched our Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) BJCx via edX on Labor Day 2015 [4]. We are simultaneously offering it as an edX Small Private Online Course (SPOC), allowing high school teachers to use it as an e-book, complete with auto-grading and a class dashboard. More than sixteen thousand learners from all over the world signed up! In this article, we share our philosophy, an update on our course design principles, a general flow through our curriculum, the impact BJC has had, and conclude with lessons learned. PHILOSOPHY Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a CS Principles course whose guiding philosophy is to meet students where they are, but not to leave them there. It cov-ers the big ideas and computational thinking practices required in the AP CSP curriculum framework and powerful computer science ideas like recursion and higher-order functions. The programming part of the course uses Snap!, an easy-to-learn blocks-based programming language based on Scratch. Through the course, students learn to create beautiful images, and realize that code itself can be beautiful. Having fun is an explicit course goal. We take a " lab-centric " approach, and much of the learning occurs through guided programming labs that ask students to explore and play. When approaching a new topic, we use the maxim of " experience before formality " —we ask them to tinker around with a new idea (perhaps by exploring a new set of blocks in Snap!) before formally explaining how everything works. Formative assess-ments inform instruction through daily For You To Do activities in the lab that are shown to partners, groups, and the instructor. Take It Further activities in the labs (sometimes open-ended) and the opportunity for stu-dents to work at their own pace through the labs pro-vide differentiated learning. We suggest that students use pair programming throughout the semester, with},

Free-choice, open-ended projects are encouraged to promote learner agency and leverage the affordances of these novice-programming environments that also support creative engagement in CS. This mixed methods research examines what we can learn about student learning from such programming artifacts. Using an extensive rubric created to evaluate these projects along several dimensions, we coded a sample of ~80 Scratch and App Inventor projects randomly selected from 20 middle school classrooms in a diverse urban school district in the US. We present key elements of our rubric, and report on noteworthy trends including the types of artifacts created and which key programming constructs are or are not commonly used. We also report on how factors such as students' gender, grade, and teachers' teaching experience influenced students' projects. We discuss differences between programming environments in terms of artifacts created, use of computing constructs, complexity of projects, and use of features of the environment for creativity, interactivity, and engagement. Our findings will help educators of introductory computing be more cognizant of how best to leverage the programming environments they are using, and what aspects they need to focus on as they attempt to address the learning needs of all in "CS For All."},

Building on this idea, we present Misconception-Driven Feedback (MDF); MDF uses a cognitive student model and program analysis to detect mistakes and uncover underlying misconceptions. To evaluate the impact of MDF on student learning, we performed a quasi-experimental study of novice programmers that compares conventional run-time and output check feedback against MDF over three semesters. In-ferential statistics indicates MDF supports significantly accelerated acquisition of conceptual knowledge and practical programming skills. Additionally, we present descriptive analysis from the study indicating the MDF student model allows for complex analysis of student mistakes and misconceptions that can suggest improvements to the feedback, the instruction, and to specific students.},

Identifying these misconceptions is a difficult task, however, and one which requires considerable previous experience with the students. In fact, sometimes it is difficult to relate these misconceptions to the elements in the knowledge diagnostic system which feeds the student model. In this paper we present a data-driven technique which aims to help elicit the domain misconceptions.

In Parsons problems, learners are given a set of programming statements that they must assemble into the correct order. Parsons problems commonly use distractors, extra statements that are not part of the solution. Yet, little is known about the effect distractors have on a learner's ability to acquire new programming skills. We present a study comparing the effectiveness of learning programming from Parsons problems with and without distractors. The results suggest that distractors decrease learning efficiency. We found that distractor participants showed no difference in transfer task performance compared to those without distractors. However, the distractors increased learners cognitive load, decreased their success at completing Parsons problems by 26{\%}, and increased learners' time on task by 14{\%}.},

Ninety-one items were developed according to a procedure that ensured content alignment to the targeted standards and construct validity. The items were administered to 13360 middle school, high school, and college students from across the USA, and the student data were analyzed using Rasch modeling. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to examine the progression of understanding of chemistry from middle school to college and revealed an overall increase in understanding with increasing grade level. Option probability curves for several of the items were used to provide insight into how students' thinking changes with increasing knowledge of the ideas being tested. In some cases, hierarchies of misconceptions were detected in which the misconceptions decrease in a series as the overall student performance level increases. Additionally, for one item, the peculiar shape of the option probability curve for a distractor indicated a flaw in the item. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

	abstract     = {Attention mechanisms have seen wide adoption in neural NLP models. In addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly) as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful {``}explanations{''} for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be treated as though they do.},

Although many studies have investigated mistakes that students make during programming, we do not know much about the quality of their code. This study examines the presence of quality issues related to program flow, choice of programming constructs and functions, clarity of expressions, decomposition and modularization in a large set of student Java programs. We investigated which issues occur most frequently, if students are able to solve these issues over time and if the use of code analysis tools has an effect on issue occurrence. We found that students hardly fix issues, in particular issues related to modularization, and that the use of tooling does not have much effect on the occurrence of issues.},

	abstract     = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

It is hence typical for the educators to try to constantly improve their teaching methods to enhance the quality and outcome of the courses. We have developed an educational tool called ViLLE, which allows us to create interactive and automatically assessed programming exercises easily. In these exercises, the students have a near-to-authentic programming environment with compiler output and error messages provided. The same tool was used in our university's introductory programming course's final exam. In this paper, we analyze students' answers to three different coding exercises in this final exam. Since ViLLE automatically stores the program code when compiled, we have an access to previously unseen amounts of iterations of the exercise instead of just the final submission. The data is analyzed to identify typical misconceptions in programming exercises, and to show how the students gradually improve their answers based on the results and error messages. Finally, we discuss how the results of the analysis can be utilized to tackle these misconceptions during the course.},

This paper seeks to expand upon this previous research by using a more theoretically grounded approach to measuring problem solving as a means of predicting performance in an introductory undergraduate programming course. Programming course performance has typically been measured by overall course grades; however, in this paper we used a more fine-grained approach to measuring student programming performance. Specifically, we utilized different types of course assignments (projects and tests) to measure programming outcomes. Results from this study indicate that problem solving ability significantly correlates with performance on programming assignments, but does not correlate with performance on multiple-choice exams.},

In order for educational technologies to make full use of students' performance data to estimate the knowledge of a student, it is important to model not only the conceptions but also the misconceptions that a student's particular pattern of successes and errors may indicate. The student models that drive the "outer loop" of Intelligent Tutoring Systems typically do not represent or track misconceptions. Here, we present a method of representing misconceptions in the Knowledge Component models, or Q-Matrices, that are used by student models to estimate latent knowledge. We show, in a case study on a fraction arithmetic dataset, that incorporating a misconception into the Knowledge Component model dramatically improves the overall model's fit to data. We also derive qualitative insights from comparing predicted learning curves across models that incorporate varying misconceptionrelated parameters. Finally, we show that the inclusion of a misconception in the Knowledge Component model can yield individual student estimates of misconception strength that are significantly correlated with out-of-tutor measures of student errors.},

Research as to the effects of such a pedagogical approach remains less studied in the extant literature. This yearlong investigation collects multiple data sources from 42 university freshmen in an experimental group (EG, N=21) and a control group (CG, N=21). Results indicate that the EG statistically outperforms the CG in oral proficiency development after the interventions. While there is no significant difference between the two groups in terms of overall and outside-class willingness to communicate in the target language, it appears that the CG perceives more in-class willingness at the end of this study. Qualitative data sources reveal the EG's positive attitude toward joining this shared blog platform and several concerns raised by some of these learners during the learning process.},

	abstract     = {Pair Programming is often employed in educational settings as a means of promoting collaboration and scaffolding the assignment difficulty for teams. While much research supports its inclusion as a pedagogical practice at the university level, some research has demonstrated in K-12 contexts, it can potentially lead to inequitable learning enviroments and create dynamics between partners that might negatively effect novice learners. New block-based programming environments like Netsblox have attempted to address this by creating ways for both partners to program simultaneously, but this feature has yet to be examined in detail. In this paper, we introduce several modes of Collaboration afforded by Netsblox. This includes Pair-Separate, Pair-Together, and Partner Puzzles - a mode that Splits the necessary blocks to build the assignment between team members. From an initial pilot study involving 25 pairs of middle and high school students, we find that most pairs preferred working on assignments in the Partner Puzzle mode as it presented a fun challenge to teams. We end on recommendations for building assignments using this methodology and future research directions investigating the role of collaboration in programming},

Past research indicates that the personal relevance of the ECS experience influences students' expectancy-value towards computer science. Expectancy-value is a construct that is predictive of career choices. We extended our research to examine whether expectancy-value influences the development of computational thinking practices. This study took place in the context of two ECS implementation projects across two states. Twenty teachers, who implemented ECS in 2016-17, participated in the research. There were 906 students who completed beginning and end of year surveys and assessments. The surveys included demographic questions, a validated expectancy-value scale, and questions about students' course experiences. The assessments were developed and validated by SRI International as a companion to the ECS course. Overall, student performance statistically increased from pretest to posttest with effect size of 0.74. There were no statistically significant differences in performance by gender or race/ethnicity. These results are consistent with earlier findings that a personally relevant course experience positively influences students' expectancy for success. These results expanded on prior research by indicating that students' expectancy-value for computer science positively influenced student learning.},

Both these behaviors are at odds with accepted practice in computer science that encourages one: (a) to start by designing an algorithm to solve a problem, and (b) to use programming constructs to cleanly structure programs.

Misconception detection enables instructors to deliver more targeted feedback on the misconceptions exhibited by many students in their class, thus improving the quality of instruction. In this paper, we propose a new natural language processing-based framework to detect the common misconceptions among students' textual responses to short-answer questions. We propose a probabilistic model for students' textual responses involving misconceptions and experimentally validate it on a real-world student-response dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed framework excels at classifying whether a response exhibits one or more misconceptions. More importantly, it can also automatically detect the common misconceptions exhibited across responses from multiple students to multiple questions; this property is especially important at large scale, since instructors will no longer need to manually specify all possible misconceptions that students might exhibit.},

Within Deep Thought is a data-driven mastery learning system (DDML), which cal- culates student proficiency based on rule scores weighted by expert-decided weights in order to assign problem sets of appropriate difficulty. In this study, we designed and tested a data-driven proficiency profiler (DDPP) method in order to calculate student proficiency without expert involvement. The DDPP determines student proficiency by comparing rel- evant student rule scores to previous students who behaved similarly in the tutor and successfully completed it. This method was compared to the original DDML method, pro- ficiency based on average rule scores, and proficiency based on minimum rule scores. Our testing has shown that while the DDPP has the potential to accurately calculate student proficiency, more data is required to improve it. Keywords},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

The results show that ITAP is capable of producing hints for almost any given state after being given only a single reference solution, and that it can improve its performance by collecting data over time.},

AIA opens up the world of mobile apps to novice programmers. Success stories of using AIA to introduce college students to programming exist. We used AIA in computing summer camps for high school students that we offer at our university. This paper is an experience report about using AIA in our camps. We provide a detailed description of designing our camps with AIA including the process of selecting and setting-up an Android device and instructional materials that we developed and made available to everyone. We evaluated our camps through surveys to determine the effects on the students. We found that there was mostly a slight increase in the favorable disposition towards computing. We also share our successes with using AIA and what still needs improvement for wider use.},

	abstract     = {This article reviews the corpus of research on feedback, with a focus on formative feedback—defined as information communicated to the learner that is intended to modify his or her thinking or behavior to improve learning. According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner's part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback's success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback.},

	abstract     = {Open-ended programming increases students' motivation by allowing them to solve authentic problems and connect programming to their own interests. However, such open-ended projects are also challenging, as they often encourage students to explore new programming features and attempt tasks that they have not learned before. Code examples are effective learning materials for students and are well-suited to supporting open-ended programming. However, there is little work to understand how novices learn with examples during open-ended programming, and few real-world deployments of such tools. In this paper, we explore novices' learning barriers when interacting with code examples during open-ended programming. We deployed Example Helper, a tool that offers galleries of code examples to search and use, with 44 novice students in an introductory programming classroom, working on an open-ended project in Snap. We found three high-level barriers that novices encountered when using examples: decision, search, and integration barriers. We discuss how these barriers arise and design opportunities to address them.},

	abstract     = {Programming environments such as Snap, Scratch, and Processing engage learners by allowing them to create programming artifacts such as apps and games, with visual and interactive output. Learning programming with such a media-focused context has been shown to increase retention and success rate. However, assessing these visual, interactive projects requires time and laborious manual effort, and it is therefore difficult to offer automated or real-time feedback to students as they work. In this paper, we introduce SnapCheck, a dynamic testing framework for Snap that enables instructors to author test cases with Condition-Action templates. The goal of SnapCheck is to allow instructors or researchers to author property-based test cases that can automatically assess students' interactive programs with high accuracy. Our evaluation of SnapCheck on 162 code snapshots from a Pong game assignment in an introductory programming course shows that our automated testing framework achieves at least 98% accuracy over all rubric items, showing potentials to use SnapCheck for auto-grading and providing formative feedback to students.},

We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence.
